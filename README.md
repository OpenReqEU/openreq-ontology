# openreq-ontology

This ontology was created as a result of the OpenReq project funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No 732463.

## Technical description

The OpenReq ontology defines the key concepts and their relationships as well as provides a blueprint for the data. In practical software engineering scenarios, the ontology is realized and used in the JSON-based messages exchanged between the different microservices in the OpenReq infrastructure. Towards this end, the Openreq JSON schema adhering to the OpenReq ontology is provided. The microservices of OpenReq also rely on the ontology in their internal data to some extent.
